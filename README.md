# kernel-detection-using-hog-svm


The main goal of this project is to gain a fundamental understanding of how HOG+SVM be used in computer vision applications to detect grain kernels from images. Even though it doesn't give a high accuracy, we explore this technique to understand how traditional machine learning algorithms can be used as object detection techniques and what can we do to improve them.

The code is provided in the Jupyter notebook.

Explanation and Analysis of the project is given in hog-svm.pdf
